----1a. 
An association list is a list of cons cells in which the children are associated with one another (as in a dictionary or map). The car of each cons cell is the key and the cdr is the value associated with that key.

----1b. 
The assoc function returns the first cons cell in the association list whose cdr matches the item given in the first parameter to the assoc function.

    (assoc 'r '((a . b) (c . d) 
                (r . x) (s . y) 
                (r . z)))

In the example above, the assoc function returns the cons cell (r . x) because it is the first cons whose cdr matches the given symbol 'r.

----1c.
The mapcar function applies a function to the elements of a given list. 

    (mapcar '1- '(1 2 3)) => (0 1 2)

In the example above, the mapcar function applies the function 1- on each element of the given list.

----1d.
Create a hash table:
    (setq x (make-hash-table))
Write something into the hash table:
    (setf (gethash 'name x) 'ted)
Read the value back:
    (gethash 'name x) => TED

----1e.
The command sublis takes in an association list and a tree. For each leaf in the tree that matches a key in the association list, the leaf is replaced with the value associated with the key.

(sublis '((one . 1) (two . 2)) '(one two three four)) => (1 2 THREE FOUR)

In the example above, sublis takes an association list '((one . 1) (two . 2)) and replaces the values in the tree '(one two three four).
